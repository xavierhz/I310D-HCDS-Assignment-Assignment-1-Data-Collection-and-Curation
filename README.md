# Analysis
It was interesting to see that the City of Austin and Austin Energy categorized where their EV charging stations were location.
Therefore, I decided to see what the distribution for charging stations in each category looked like. There was a higher number 
of charging stations located in areas such as Workplace, Parking, Multifamily Commercial, and Municipal. On the contrary, 
categories such as Education, Healthcare, Retail, Parks and Recreation, and Hospitality had a much lower number of EV Charging 
Stations available for use. I think this is some of the most important information from the data set as we can see which areas 
have higher access to charging stations. This is definitely something to take into account considering an increasing number 
of people everywhere have begun to purchase EVs.
